# shape game
### made as described by vex in like ~10 minutes

[19:08] Vex'd: not my type of game but looks good ðŸ‘€ , hope it's good  
[19:14] Vex'd: what i want is like a bunch of colored shapes you click on, and like to start there's 3, and when you click on the right one at random you go to the next level with 4, etc, if you click on the wrong one nothing happens, no end to the number of levels
